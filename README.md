# Hotspot detection Yeast Cell Model - Image Processing

Yeast cell act models to study neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease etc. They have been strongly correlated to unregulated amyloidosis. These manifests are erratic misfoldings of proteins and lead to irreversible functional degeneration of cells. Phenomenologically, this leads to specific protein aggregations and eventually the onset of the disease. The protein bundling or aggregations at the cellular level has been observed experimentally using both optical and electron microscopic techniques. Fluorescence imaging modality has been extensively utilized in this regard to capture these protein aggregations in real time. The inherent advantages of fluorescence imaging technique allow researchers to map hyper localization of biological processes as well as biomaterial transport at cellular levels.  

In this protect we aim at detection of cell wall and the postion of protien hotspot inside the cell by post-processing on the fluorescence image using OpenCV library.
